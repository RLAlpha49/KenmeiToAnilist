2. You'll be redirected to AniList's authorization page
3. Log in to your AniList account and authorize the app
4. You'll be redirected back to the app with authentication complete

> **Note**: Your AniList credentials are only used for API access. The app has read/write access only to your manga list, not other sensitive data.

## üì• Importing Your Data

### Using the Import Page

1. **Navigate to Import** from the home page
2. **Drag and Drop** your CSV file onto the upload area, or
3. **Click "Select File"** to browse for your CSV file
4. **File Validation** - The app will check your CSV format
5. **Preview Data** - Review the first few entries to ensure correct import
6. **Confirm Import** - Click the import button to start processing

The import process will:

- Parse your CSV file
- Extract manga titles and metadata
- Store data locally on your computer
- Prepare data for matching

### Handling Import Errors

If import fails:

- **Check file format** - Ensure it's a valid CSV file
- **Check for empty rows** - Remove blank lines in your CSV
- **Verify encoding** - Ensure file is UTF-8 encoded
- **Check column headers** - Verify required columns are present

If problems persist, check the error message displayed or collect debug logs (see [Collecting Debug Logs](#collecting-debug-logs)).

## üéØ Understanding the Matching Process

### Automatic Matching

The app uses intelligent algorithms to match your manga titles with AniList's database:

1. **Exact Title Match** - Looks for identical titles first
2. **Fuzzy Matching** - Handles variations in spelling/formatting
3. **Alternative Titles** - Checks English, Japanese, and romanized names
4. **Year/Publication Date** - Uses dates to distinguish between series
5. **Format Matching** - Considers manga format (Manga, Light Novel, One-shot, etc.)

### Match Confidence Levels

The matching algorithm assigns confidence scores to each potential match:

- **üü¢ High Confidence (80%+)** - Very likely correct match, safe to use automatically
- **üü° Medium Confidence (50-80%)** - Probable match, review recommended
- **üî¥ Low Confidence (<50%)** - Uncertain match, manual review strongly recommended
- **‚ùå No Match** - No suitable match found in AniList database

### Manual Matching

For unmatched or uncertain entries:

1. **Click the manga entry** to open match options
2. **Search AniList** manually using the built-in search box
3. **Browse search results** to find the correct series
4. **Select the match** from search results
5. **Confirm the match** to update your collection

Tips for manual matching:

- Try searching with different title formats (English, Japanese, shortened titles)
- Check publication years to ensure correct series
- Look at cover images to verify
- Read descriptions to confirm series identity

### Undo and Redo Actions

The matching interface includes built-in undo/redo functionality to help you experiment with different match selections without fear of losing your progress:

**Supported Actions:**

- Accepting matches
- Rejecting/skipping matches
- Selecting alternative matches
- Resetting matches to pending status
- Manual search selections

**Using Undo/Redo:**

- **Undo**: Press `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Z` (Mac) to undo the last action
- **Redo**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Ctrl+Y` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+Z` (Mac) to redo
- Click the **Undo** (‚Ü∂) and **Redo** (‚Ü∑) buttons in the header for mouse navigation
- Buttons are disabled when there are no actions to undo/redo

**Important Notes:**

- Undo history stores the last 50 actions only
- Undo/redo is disabled during active matching to prevent conflicts
- Using "Fresh Search (Clear Cache)" will clear the undo history
- Rematch operations will reset the undo history to prevent inconsistent state

**Tip**: Use undo/redo to safely try different match selections. If you're not sure about a choice, you can always undo and try something else!

## üé® Custom Matching Rules (Advanced)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced Feature**: Custom matching rules require knowledge of regular expressions (regex). Incorrect patterns can skip desired manga or cause performance issues. Only use this feature if you're comfortable with regex syntax.

Define custom rules to automatically skip or accept manga based on specific metadata fields (titles, genres, tags, authors, format, country, source, description, publishing status).

### Accessing Custom Rules

1. Navigate to Settings page
2. Click the "Matching" tab
3. Scroll to "Advanced: Custom Matching Rules" section (closed by default for safety)
4. Click to expand the advanced section

### Selecting Target Fields

Choose which metadata fields the regex pattern should check:

**Text Fields**:

- **Titles**: All title variants (romaji, english, native, synonyms, alternative titles) - Default
- **Author/Staff**: Author names and staff credits (story, art, original creator)
- **Description/Notes**: Manga description and your personal notes

**Metadata**:

- **Genres**: Genre tags (Action, Romance, Fantasy, etc.)
- **Tags**: Detailed tags with categories (Overpowered MC, Time Travel, etc.)
- **Format**: Publication format (Manga, Light Novel, One-Shot, Manhwa, Manhua)

**Content Info**:

- **Country of Origin**: Country code (JP, KR, CN, etc.)
- **Source Material**: Original source (Original, Manga, Light Novel, etc.)
- **Publishing Status**: Current publishing status (Finished, Publishing, etc.)

**Multiple Field Selection**:

- Select multiple fields to check pattern against all selected metadata
- Pattern matches if it matches ANY of the selected fields
- Example: Select "Titles" + "Genres" to match manga with "action" in title OR genres

**Field-Specific Examples**:

- **Genres**: Pattern `action|adventure` matches manga with Action or Adventure genres
- **Author**: Pattern `^oda` matches manga by authors starting with "Oda"
- **Format**: Pattern `^(NOVEL|ONE_SHOT)$` matches Light Novels and One-Shots
- **Tags**: Pattern `isekai|reincarnation` matches manga with those tag themes

### Rule Types

**Skip Rules**: Automatically exclude manga from matching results

- Use cases: Filter out anthologies, specific publishers, unwanted formats
- Example patterns:
  - `anthology` - Skip manga with "anthology" in title
  - `^one.?shot$` - Skip one-shots (case-insensitive)
  - `(vol|volume)\s*\d+` - Skip volume compilations

**Accept Rules**: Automatically boost confidence for matching results

- Use cases: Prioritize specific series, publishers, or formats
- Example patterns:
  - `^naruto` - Boost Naruto series
  - `shueisha` - Boost Shueisha publications
  - `official.*translation` - Boost official translations

### Creating Rules

1. Click "Add Rule" button in Skip Rules or Accept Rules section
2. Enter a description (e.g., "Skip anthologies")
3. Select target fields (which metadata to check)
4. Enter regex pattern (e.g., `anthology`)
5. Toggle case-sensitive if needed (default: case-insensitive)
6. Toggle enabled (default: enabled)
7. Review the Regex Pattern Guide (expanded section) for safe patterns
8. Click "Save Rule"

### Comprehensive Regex Pattern Guide

**Basic Syntax**:

- **Literal text**: `anthology` - matches the word "anthology" anywhere
- **Start anchor**: `^one shot` - matches text starting with "one shot"
- **End anchor**: `anthology$` - matches text ending with "anthology"
- **Both anchors**: `^exact match$` - matches only "exact match"
- **Word boundary**: `\bvol\b` - matches "vol" as a complete word
- **Any character**: `.` - matches any single character (use sparingly)
- **Escape special chars**: `\.`, `\*`, `\+`, `\?` - match literal . * + ?

**Quantifiers** (repetition):

- **Zero or one**: `colou?r` - matches "color" or "colour"
- **Zero or more**: `\d*` - matches zero or more digits (use with caution)
- **One or more**: `\d+` - matches one or more digits
- **Exact count**: `\d{4}` - matches exactly 4 digits
- **Range**: `\d{2,4}` - matches 2 to 4 digits
- **Bounded repeats**: Always prefer `{min,max}` over `*` or `+` for safety

**Character Classes**:

- **Digits**: `\d` or `[0-9]` - matches any digit
- **Word characters**: `\w` or `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` - matches letters, digits, underscore
- **Whitespace**: `\s` - matches space, tab, newline
- **Custom class**: `[abc]` - matches a, b, or c
- **Negated class**: `[^abc]` - matches anything except a, b, or c
- **Range**: `[a-z]`, `[A-Z]`, `[0-9]`

**Grouping and Alternation**:

- **Alternation**: `manga|manhwa|manhua` - matches any of the options
- **Grouping**: `(one|two) shot` - matches "one shot" or "two shot"
- **Non-capturing**: `(?:pattern)` - group without capturing (better performance)

**‚úÖ Safe Pattern Examples**:

- `^one.?shot$` - matches "one shot" or "one-shot" (bounded)
- `\b(vol|volume)\s*\d{1,3}\b` - matches "vol 1" to "volume 999" (bounded)
- `^[a-z]{3,50}$` - matches 3-50 lowercase letters (bounded)
- `anthology|collection` - simple alternation (no quantifiers)
- `^official.*translation$` - anchored with specific start/end

**‚ùå Dangerous Patterns to Avoid**:

- `(a+)+` - **Nested quantifiers** cause exponential backtracking (ReDoS)
- `(a|aa)+` - **Overlapping alternations** cause exponential backtracking
- `^(.*a)*$` - **Catastrophic backtracking** with nested quantifiers
- `.*` - **Unbounded wildcard** matches everything (too broad)
- `.{1,10000}` - **Very large bounds** can cause performance issues
- `(foo|fo)+bar` - **Overlapping prefix** in alternation causes backtracking

**Security Warning - ReDoS**:

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**: Certain regex patterns can cause catastrophic backtracking, making the application freeze or crash when matching against long strings. The application validates patterns to detect these issues, but always test your patterns thoroughly.

> **Learn more**: [OWASP ReDoS Guide](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)

**Best Practices**:

1. **Start simple**: Use literal text first, add complexity only if needed
2. **Use anchors**: `^` and `$` make patterns more specific and faster
3. **Prefer bounds**: Use `{min,max}` instead of `*` or `+` when possible
4. **Test thoroughly**: Use the "Test Pattern" feature with various inputs
5. **Avoid nesting**: Never nest quantifiers like `(a+)+` or `(.*)*`
6. **Be specific**: `\d{4}` is better than `\d+` if you expect 4 digits
7. **Check performance**: Complex patterns on long strings can be slow

- Fix validation errors before saving
- Review pattern complexity warnings for dangerous patterns

### Managing Rules

- **Edit**: Click edit icon to modify rule
- **Delete**: Click delete icon and confirm removal
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle switch to activate/deactivate rule

### How Rules Work

- **Skip rules** run during automatic matching (not manual search)
- **Accept rules** boost confidence scores to ensure inclusion
- Rules check selected metadata fields (configurable per rule)
- Pattern matches if it matches ANY of the selected fields
- Multiple rules can match the same manga (first match wins)
- Custom rules run after system rules (light novels, hardcoded blacklist)

### Important Notes

- Custom rules only apply to automatic matching
- Manual searches ignore skip rules (all results shown)
- Invalid regex patterns are highlighted and cannot be saved
- ReDoS-vulnerable patterns trigger warnings (can still be saved)
- Disabled rules are stored but not evaluated
- Rules persist across app restarts
- Existing rules default to checking "titles" field for backward compatibility

### Examples

**Skip Rule Examples**:

- Description: "Skip anthologies", Pattern: `anthology`
- Description: "Skip one-shots", Pattern: `^one.?shot$`
- Description: "Skip volume compilations", Pattern: `vol(ume)?\s*\d+`

**Accept Rule Examples**:

- Description: "Prioritize official translations", Pattern: `official`
- Description: "Boost Shonen Jump titles", Pattern: `shonen\s*jump`
- Description: "Accept Viz Media", Pattern: `viz\s*media`

### Troubleshooting

- **Pattern doesn't match**: Test with "Test Pattern" button, check regex syntax
- **Too many matches skipped**: Review skip rules, disable overly broad patterns
- **Rule not working**: Verify rule is enabled, check pattern is valid
- **Validation error**: Fix regex syntax, escape special characters (\\, ., *, +, ?, etc.)

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is my data safe?**

A: Yes. Your data is stored locally on your computer and never transmitted except to AniList for synchronization.

**Q: Can I undo a synchronization?**

A: No, but you can review changes in the preview before syncing. Always backup your AniList data first by exporting it.

**Q: Does this app work offline?**

A: Partial offline support. You can import CSV files offline, but syncing requires an internet connection.

**Q: Can I sync partial data?**

A: Yes, you can select which fields to sync (status, progress, scores, etc.) in the sync configuration before starting.

### Import & Matching

**Q: Why are some manga not matching?**

A: If manga titles differ significantly from AniList database names, the automatic matching may fail. Use manual matching for these entries, or adjust the manga name in your CSV.

**Q: Can I import multiple CSV files?**

A: Currently, import one file at a time. Importing again will overwrite previous data.

**Q: How accurate is the matching?**

A: Automatic matching works well for popular manga (85-95% accuracy). Less common titles may require manual searching.

### Synchronization

**Q: How long does sync take?**

A: Typically 1-2 minutes for 50-100 manga, but varies based on:

- Number of manga to sync
- Current AniList API load
- AniList rate limiting (60 requests per minute)

**Q: Will my AniList data be overwritten?**

A: Only fields you configured for syncing will be updated. Existing data in other fields remains unchanged.

**Q: What if sync fails partway?**

A: Failed entries are logged and can be retried from the results page. Check debug logs for error details.

**Q: Can I sync to multiple AniList accounts?**

A: Only one account at a time. You can switch accounts in Settings ‚Üí Authentication.
